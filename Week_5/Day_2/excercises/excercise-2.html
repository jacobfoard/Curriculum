		Just a small town girl</br>
		Livin' in a lonely world</br>
		She took the midnight train</br>
		Goin' anywhere</br>
		Just a city boy</br>
		Born and raised in South Detroit</br>
		He took the midnight train</br>
		Goin' anywhere</br>
</p>
<p>
		A singer in a smokey </br>
		The smell of wine and cheap perfume</br>
		For a smile they can share the night</br>
		It goes on and on and on and on</br>
</p>
<p>
		Strangers waiting</br>
		Up and down the boulevard</br>
		Their shadows searching</br>
		In the night</br>
		Streetlight people</br>
		Livin' just to find emotion</br>
		Hidin' somewhere in the night</br>
</p>
