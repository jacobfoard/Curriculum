         * So we want to create a feature that allows you to store your movies in our 'cloud'.
         *
         * We want to make sure that you can find and catalog your movies correctly, so we
         * would like to give users the ability to provide a description of these movies.
         *
         * We want users to also see any products they have ordered on the same page.
         *
         * Create a class called CloudMovieFile that also implements the Describable interface.  Use your imagination on
         * how this should describe itself.  Create an instance of Cloud movie.  Now create a Clothing object and a
         * Television object from the classes you built in the previous exercise.  Put these 3 objects in an array
         * names $customerItems.
         *
         * Create a new class called ItemDescriber.  Item describer should contain a method called
         * outputDescription.  This method should take an object that implements the Describable interface
         * as a parameter.  If the parameter does not implement the Describable interface, throw an exception
         * Otherwise, the outputDescription method should printout the description of the object that is passed in.
         *
         * @see  http://php.net/manual/en/language.operators.type.php
         *
         * For each object in the array, use the ItemDescriber to print out the description of all of your Describable
         * objects.
         *
         * Note that we can treat anything that wants to implment describable exactly the same, whether it is a
         * Product or a CloudMovieFile.  You could even create a Person class that implements Describable and
         * run it through the ItemDescriber method.
