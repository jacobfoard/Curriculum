    /**
     * It's time to create a hero to dispatch these pesky monsters.
     *
     * Copy your code from the previous exercise.
     *
     * Add a SETTER method to your LivingThing class named "setHealth" that lets you update the value
     * of the "health" property.
     *
     * Now, create a NEW class "Hero" that EXTENDS the LivingThing class.
     *
     * Add a method to the Hero class named "attack" that takes as a parameter a LivingThing object.
     * The method should do three things:
     * 1. Reduce the LivingThing object's health by a random value between 0 and 10.
     * 2. Reduce the hero's health by a random value between 0 and 10.
     * 3. Print out how much damage the monster and hero did to each other.
     *
     * For help generating random numbers:
     * @see http://php.net/manual/en/function.mt-rand.php
     *
     * Give the Hero class another method named "fight" that takes as a parameter an array of LivingThing objects
     * and does the following:
     *  - For each LivingThing object in the array, call the "attack" method so the hero can attack the monster.
     *     - But, don't attack if the LivingThing is already dead!
     *  - Repeat the process until all the monsters or the hero is dead.
     *
     * Finally, you will need to create your hero object with the name "hero". Give them 100 health and a
     * name of your choice.
